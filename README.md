# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This work day scheduler is a simple app with which a user can add events and save them to an hour block from 9am-5pm. The page will display the day's date and color code the boxes based on the time. 
As part of the UMN coding bootcamp I was given starter code for the HTML and CSS. I wrote the JavaScript to practice and learn about using day.js and local storage. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

when you click into any text area, you will be able to enter notes and events for each hour. When you click on a save button to the right, the notes from that hour block will be saved to local storage. When the page is refreshed, those saved notes will persist.
